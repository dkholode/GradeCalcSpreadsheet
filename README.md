### How it works (Inputs):
Run the program and answer the following questions:
  1. Total number of categories (HW, Exams, Participation, etc)
  2. For each category:
      1. What is the naming scheme for these assignments? (Ex: HW #, Exam #, etc)
      2. How many of this assignment type are there?
      3. How much is each assignment worth? (As a total of %)
      
Answering all the questions generates a spreadsheet where you can enter your current grade for each assignment to find your total grade.
