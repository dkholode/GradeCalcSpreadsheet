### How it works (Inputs):
Run the program and answer the following questions:
  1. Total number of categories (HW, Exams, Participation, etc)
  2. For each category:
      1. Assignment name structure (`HW_#`, `Midterm #`, etc)
      2. Total number of assignments?
      3. How much is each assignment worth?
      
Answering all the questions generates a spreadsheet where you can enter your current grade for each assignment to find your total grade.
